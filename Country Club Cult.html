<p>           We were five hours in,  my feet had entered the last circle of Dante’s inferno and I was starting to make the same wincing expression that Sarah, the pregnant hostess, made every time she got up. My body ached all over, my ankles were actually starting to swell, and I was throwing away fifty-dollar steak and thinking about starving children. Starving children and how much I hated him being there. I knew the second I said it, that little phrase, that come December 10th I would rue the day I said it.

  <p>“Why don’t you just work with me?”

  <p>It was a horrible idea when I thought of it, but I said it anyway, just to be nice. You’re supposed to be nice, help your friends out, and support them when they’re having a hard time and all. But here I was, cringing equally about the waste of food in front of me and the fact that my friend of seven years was now working at the same job. I hated the sharing the air, sharing the knowledge, sharing the boss and the pay. We have too much of the same life and now we share how we made money. It was sickening to me, almost as sickening as my can I Find a Member Who is Not White? game, which I play frequently (and unsuccessfully.)

  <p>Noah, my dear friend and now associate. He’s a hard worker, he truly does earn his minimum wage. I should be over the moon that I don’t have another shitfaced college student college who thinks that the no cell phone rule doesn’t apply to them.
But I do, I'm craving another Justin or Josh. The perverted  type of people who check their fellow female waitstaffs asses and ask me who my favorite porn star is. The type of people that the old men who play golf  here reminisce about being.  The type of people I know the bratty twelve year old boys I was serving are going to be.

  <p>Noah isn’t like the other guys at my work; he's younger, productive and above all he’s familiar. He’s nothing like those guys… but he could be. In fact Noah could be exactly like those guys. He is still a stranger at the moment, but that will go away as time makes him less of a co-worker and more of a comrade.

  <p>There is this boys’ club at the place where I work, not anything written on paper but a social agreement between the male employees to be friendly with each other and have each others back. I’ve been working there for about five months now and the invitation has not been offered to me, and I know that it never will.  Brian and James both have only been working at the club for about two months. They arrive with everyone in the boys club, they leave with everyone in the boys club. The chef turns a blind eye to them taking home food and vaping in the hallway. They remain employed.

  <p>I disapprove of them. Not laughing at their crude jokes and opting out when they have their unauthorized breaks shows them as such. In return they disapprove of my disapproval.  I know Noah can sense the disagreement between us and I know he knows which side has more power.  Already he has seemed to have forgotten my advice and started listening to theirs instead. It was small things at first: deciding to grab the food tray the easier but far less professional way and not cleaning the plate thoroughly, and leaving more work for the dishwasher. But I truly knew that I was losing him when I saw him hiding in the storage closet on his phone.


   <p>It had been only seven hours since he had been employed here and he had somehow managed to diverge himself from me and become just another asshole who I am forced to work with. Except Noah isn’t just another asshole, he’s my friend and friends are supposed to do nice things for each other, to support one another when they’re having a rough day. I fulfilled my end of the deal. I used the meger presence I had to get him a job. A job that sounds fancy and looks good on résumés. A job that I pride myself for working very hard in and a job that he wouldn’t have been able to get without my help. In return  he was leaving me for people he barely knew, people who are casual racists and make fun of my height, people who don’t like me, people he knows don’t like me. He was inducted into the country club cult, by far their fastest added member yet. There was no coming back for him.  Now I must force myself to watch from the afar, keep my distance and find a way to get him fired.


            <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

            <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

            <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
